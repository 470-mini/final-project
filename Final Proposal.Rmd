The data set we use is for Google Play Store apps. For this project, we want to figure out which variables could predict the rating of Google Play Store apps. There are overall 10841 observations and 13 variables in this data set and rating is the response variable. 

Data cited from: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

App: Application name
Category: Category the app belongs to 
Rating: Overall user rating of the apps
Reviews: Number of user reviews for the app
Size: Size of the app
Installs: Number of user downloads/installs for the app
Type: Paid or free
Price: Price of the app
Content Rating: Age group the app is targeted at
Genres: An app can belong to multiple genres
LastUpdated: Date when the app was last updated on Play Store
Current Ver: Current version of the app available on Play Store
Android Ver: Min required Android version


Among all the variables above, the predictors our group will consider inclduing in our model:
Category
Size
Installs
Type
Content Rating


Analysis:
Step 1: Filter all NA values and values larger than 10 in the response variable "rating".
Step 2: Summary of data
Step 3: Make several distribution plots of predictors alone and relationship with response variable
Step 4: Fit additive model and interactive model to decide whether we need an interaction between any two predictor variables
Step 5: Finalize our model to predict app ratings
Step 6: Evaluation of the visualization
